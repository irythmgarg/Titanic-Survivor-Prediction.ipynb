The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset widely used in machine learning and data analysis. 
It provides information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic,which sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912.




Key Features of the Dataset:
Passenger Information:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
Survival Information:

Survived: Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
Socioeconomic Class:

Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Family Information:

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Travel Details:

Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number (often incomplete).
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
Applications:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing survival rates based on gender, class, age, and other factors.
Machine Learning: Building predictive models to determine survival likelihood.
Visualization: Understanding patterns using charts and plots.
The dataset is small and well-structured, making it ideal for beginners to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.
